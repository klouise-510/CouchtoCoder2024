  <p id="spending">Spending a lot of time on your screen is necessary for many elements of modern life, with work, school, an even socialising now being heavily online. With this being the case, it's easy to become detached from yourself and the world around you, making time away from your screen more important than ever. Life can get busy and this is often easier said than done, so please use this space to take a break from endless scrolling, emails and deadlines, and plan things out thoughtfully at your own pace.</p>
